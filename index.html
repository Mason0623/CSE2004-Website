      <p class="extra-space">The Spring Festival is the most important holiday in the traditional Chinese calendar. It marks the beginning of a new year. The date changes each year, usually falling between late January and mid-February. During this time, people go back home, visit relatives and friends, and eat special holiday foods. Public places often organize traditional performances like lion dances to create a festive mood. It is also the busiest travel season in China, with millions of people making long trips to reunite with their families.</p>
      <p class="extra-space">As one of the longest public holidays of the year, the Spring Festival gives people time to focus on family and social connections. Before the holiday, many families clean their homes and put up red couplets as decoration. On New Year’s Eve, it is common for family members to have dinner together. During the holiday, some neighborhoods hold group celebrations, including lion dance performances and other traditional shows. These activities help pass down culture from one generation to the next.</p>
      <p class="extra-space">From a social point of view, the Spring Festival helps slow down daily life and strengthen family bonds. Work and business activities usually decrease for a while, and attention shifts to family gatherings and visiting friends. Traditional customs are more visible during this period. Younger family members visit elders, and red envelopes are given out. Long-standing traditions like the lion dance appear in streets and public spaces, giving the holiday a clear and familiar look each year.</p>

        <p>Traditions may vary by region and family.</p>
        <p>In southern China, especially in my HometownGuangdong, people have the tradition of visiting flower markets before the Spring Festival. These markets are crowded and colorful, filled with peach blossoms, kumquat trees, and orchids. Each plant has a meaning. Peach blossoms stand for romance, kumquat trees represent wealth, and orchids symbolize elegance and good fortune. Families buy these plants to decorate their homes and welcome good luck for the new year. Walking through the market at night, with lights and noise everywhere, is part of the holiday feeling for many locals.</p>
